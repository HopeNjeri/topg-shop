This code defines a `Color` model in Django. The model has two fields: `color_name`, which is a text field with a maximum length of 50 characters, and `time_added`, which is a DateTime field that automatically updates to the current time whenever a new color is added. The `Color` model also has a `__str__` method that returns the `color_name` as a string representation of the model.

This code defines a `Size` model with two fields: `size_number` which is a character field with a maximum length of 50, and `time_added` which is a DateTime field that automatically updates whenever a new instance is created or modified. The `__str__` method is also defined to return the `size_number` as a string representation of the model object.

This code snippet defines a `Product` model with various fields and relationships. It represents a product that can be sold on a website. The fields include `brand` (a foreign key to the `Brand` model), `shoe_image` (an image file field), `shoe_name` (a character field for the name of the shoe), `shoe_size` (a many-to-many relationship with the `Size` model), `shoe_gender` (a text field for the gender of the shoe), `shoe_color_available` (a many-to-many relationship with the `Color` model), `shoe_price` (a decimal field for the price of the shoe), `shoe_in_stock` (a boolean field to indicate if the shoe is in stock), `shoe_price_was` (a decimal field to store the previous price of the shoe), and `shoe_time_added` (a datetime field to store the time when the shoe was added). The `__str__` method is overridden to return the name of the shoe as a string representation of the model.
